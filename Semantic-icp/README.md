# About

**Name:** Semantic ICP

**Summary:** Novel point cloud registration algorithm that directly incorporates
pixelated semantic measurements into the estimation of the relative
transformation between two point clouds.

**Description:** The algorithm uses an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like scheme
and performs joint semantic and geometric inference using the
Expectation-Maximization technique in which semantic labels and point
associations between two point clouds are treated as latent random variables.
The minimization of the expected cost on the three-dimensional special Euclidean
group, i.e., SE(3), yields the rigid body transformation between two point
clouds.
